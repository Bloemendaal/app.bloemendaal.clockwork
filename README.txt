Clockwork - Remember when things happened in your Homey flows

Track event timestamps and use them to create intelligent flows that understand timing and sequence.

KEY FEATURES:
• Store timestamps of any event with custom identifiers
• Check how long ago events occurred (less than, more than, or between time ranges)
• Compare event timing and order (before, after, or simultaneous)
• Check if events have ever happened or never happened
• All data persists across app restarts - no data loss
• Smart autocomplete shows your existing events with timestamps
• Trigger flows when events are stored

PERFECT FOR:
• Detecting direction of movement (e.g., walking up or down stairs)
• Building "welcome home" flows that trigger only after absences
• Creating sequences that depend on event timing
• Monitoring appliance usage patterns
• Preventing duplicate notifications within time windows

HOW IT WORKS:
1. Use "Store that [event_id] happened" action to record events
2. Use condition cards to check timing (e.g., "door_opened happened less than 10 seconds ago")
3. Build complex automations based on event sequences and timing

EXAMPLE - Smart Stairway Lighting:
Store door opening → Check if motion sensor triggered within 10 seconds → Determine if user is going up or down → Turn lights on/off accordingly

All timestamps are stored locally on your Homey for complete privacy.
